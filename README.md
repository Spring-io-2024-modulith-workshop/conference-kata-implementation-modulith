# Spring IO 2024

## Transitioning from Monolithic Architecture to Spring Modulith

### Facilitators

* [Anyul Rivas - Ingram Micro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anyulled/)
* [Alejandro Mart√≠nez - FINEOS](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alejandrobcn/)

### Description

This interactive workshop comprehensively explores Spring Modulith,
an innovative approach to modernizing traditional monolithic architectures.
Participants will gain insights into the fundamentals of Spring Modulith,
followed by a detailed,
hands-on session
focused on migrating a standard modular monolith application to a Spring
Modulith structure.
This session is ideal for software engineers and architects
seeking practical experience
to enhance system modularity and maintainability using Spring Modulith.
Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of the process and benefits from
this transition,
equipped with the skills to implement similar upgrades in their projects.
