## Transitioning from Monolithic Architecture to Spring Modulith

### Anyul Rivas - Ingram Micro / Alejandro Mart√≠nez - FINEOS

This interactive workshop comprehensively explores Spring Modulith, an innovative approach to modernizing traditional monolithic architectures. Participants will gain insights into the fundamentals of Spring Modulith, followed by a detailed, hands-on session focused on migrating a standard modular monolith application to a Spring Modulith structure. This session is ideal for software engineers and architects seeking practical experience enhancing system modularity and maintainability using Spring Modulith. Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of the process and benefits of this transition, equipped with the skills to implement similar upgrades in their projects.
