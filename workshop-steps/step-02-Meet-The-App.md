## C4 Model

The [C4 model](https://c4model.com/) is an "abstraction-first"
approach to diagramming software architecture,
based upon abstractions
that reflect how software architects and developers think
about and build software.
The small set of abstractions and diagram types makes
the C4 model easy to learn and use.
Please note that you don't need to use all four levels of diagram;
only those that add value -
the System Context and Container diagrams are sufficient for many software
development teams.
