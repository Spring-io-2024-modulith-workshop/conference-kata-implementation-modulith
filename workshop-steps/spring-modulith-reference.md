## Libraries used by Spring Modulith

### Jmolecules

Same developer (Oliver Drotbohm) behind Spring Modulith

jMolecules is a Java framework designed to support the implementation of
Domain-Driven Design (DDD) concepts. It provides a set of annotations and types
that help developers clearly express the core DDD building blocks such as
Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates, Repositories, and more. By using
jMolecules, developers can ensure that their codebase adheres to DDD principles,
promoting better structure, readability, and maintainability.

### ArchUnit

ArchUnit is a Java library that allows developers to test the architectural
rules of their codebase. It enables the definition and enforcement of
architectural constraints through unit tests, ensuring that the code adheres to
predefined structures and patterns. With ArchUnit, developers can check for
violations such as cyclic dependencies, improper package dependencies, and
adherence to layering principles. This helps maintain a clean and consistent
architecture, making the codebase more robust and easier to maintain.
